### R2 D1: April 16 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Setup my dev environment, listened in on an online Showcase of previous EthGlobal winners.


### R2 D2: April 17 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Solidity variables like signed and unsigned ints, bools, bytes and strings. Played around with addresses, getting address balances, sent and withdrew ether to/from a smart contract address.

### R2 D3: April 18 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about global msg.object, starting/stopping/pausing a smart contract and what that means on chain, learnt about mappings and structs.

### R2 D4: April 19 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about exception handling (require, assert, revert).

### R2 D5: April 20 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about additional function types such as setters and getters (view and pure), constructors, fallback functions. Also worked with Modifiers and Inheritance.

### R2 D6: April 21 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about return variables (the lack of) and how to use events to emit logs which can then be used in the application layer (but not within smart contracts).

**Link to work**: [Events and Return Variables](https://github.com/saurabh/learning-Solidity/blob/master/Laungage%20Basics/09.Events.sol)


### R2 D7: April 22 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read about ABI Array, function hashes and debugging.


### R2 D8: April 23 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Library usage within contracts.

**Link to work**: [Example 1](https://github.com/saurabh/learning-Solidity/blob/master/Laungage%20Basics/10.Libraries.sol)
**Link to work**: [Example 2](https://github.com/saurabh/learning-Solidity/blob/master/Laungage%20Basics/11.Libraries2.sol)


### R2 D9: April 24 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a shared wallet contract that allows the contract owner to set allowances for other people which they can withdraw. Contract owner can withdraw all funds if needed. (use cases: company expense account, household allowances for kids)

**Thoughts**: This is the first contract that I wrote from scratch using the learnings of the past week. Feelsgoodman.

### R2 D10: April 25 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Going through the course solution for the SharedWallet contract that I wrote yesterday. Had a meeting with my HackMoney Team regarding our hackathon project.


### R2 D11: April 26 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the course solution for the SharedWallet project. Used events to create logs of withdrawals and funds received and allowance changes. Its much more elegant than what I wrote, learnt a lot.
