**Today's Progress**: Setup my dev environment, listened in on an online Showcase of previous EthGlobal winners. 


### R2 D2: April 17 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Solidity variables like signed and unsigned ints, bools, bytes and strings. Played around with addresses, getting address balances, sent and withdrew ether to/from a smart contract address.

### R2 D3: April 18 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about global msg.object, starting/stopping/pausing a smart contract and what that means on chain, learnt about mappings and structs.

### R2 D4: April 19 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about exception handling (require, assert, revert).

**Link to work**: [Modifiers, Inheritance and File Imports](https://github.com/saurabh/learning-Solidity/blob/master/8.Modifiers%26Inheritence.sol)


### R2 D6: April 21 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about return variables (the lack of) and how to use events to emit logs which can then be used in the application layer (but not within smart contracts).

**Link to work**: [Events and Return Variables](https://github.com/saurabh/learning-Solidity/blob/master/9.Events.sol)


### R2 D7: April 22 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read about ABI Array, function hashes and debugging.
