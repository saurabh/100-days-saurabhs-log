### R2 D27: May 12 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the first project. We compile, test and deploy in Nodejs using solc and mocha in this project. The course is from 3 years ago so its a little dated. Rewriting all the code to fit Solidity ^0.6.7 so its taking a bit longer than usual.

### R2 D28: May 13 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added Web3 and Mocha to the project, wrote a couple of tests but there's some issues with getting solc to work. Updating this codebase is turning out to be quite cumbersome.


### R2 D29: May 14 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to use the older solidity versions as per the course. Also, went through the LiquiDeFi codebase and working through some local errors with testing.


### R2 D30: May 15 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the course project to solidity 0.4.17.

### R2 D35: May 20 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got some more lines in on the lottery contract. It can now randomly generate a number using keccak256 hashing and picks a winner based on that. Will push the repo tomorrow.


### R2 D36: May 21 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made some good progress today. On the previous project I struggled to get the tests and deployment working with the latest version of solc compiler. I figured it out in this project. Contract completed, started unit testing.
