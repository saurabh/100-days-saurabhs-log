The log of my 100 Days Of Code

<!-- [Round 1](R1.md) -->

### R1 D1: April 1 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 1st Project from javascript30. Started warm up exercises on hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** Took me an hour to complete the Staircase problem on Hackerrank lol. JS Drum kit was fun. Learnt about data-keys and audio files and the nuances of queryselector.
