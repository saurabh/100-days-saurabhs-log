The log of my 100 Days Of Code

<!-- [Round 1](R1.md) -->

### R1 D1: April 1 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 1st Project from javascript30. Started warm up exercises on hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: Took me an hour to complete the Staircase problem on Hackerrank lol. JS Drum kit was fun. Learnt about data-keys and audio files and the nuances of queryselector.

### R1 D3: April 3 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 3rd Project from javascript30. Done with hackerrank warmup exercies.

**Thoughts**: Was pretty tough to get started today. One of those days where you don't want to do anything and just sleep in. But I went through with it anyway, albiet a little lazily. Didn't know CSS Variables were a thing. Also this.dataset to fetch data attributes is neat.
