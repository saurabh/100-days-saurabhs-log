### R1 D1: April 1 Wednesday

### R1 D3: April 3 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 3rd Project from javascript30. Done with hackerrank warmup exercises.

**Thoughts**: Was pretty tough to get started today. One of those days where you don't want to do anything, sleep in a little longer and take it easy. But I went through with it anyway, albeit a little slow. Didn't know CSS Variables were a thing. Also this.dataset to fetch data attributes is neat.
